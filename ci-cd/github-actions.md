# GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform integrated directly into your GitHub repository.

## Key Concepts
- **Workflow:** An automated process defined in a YAML file.
- **Event:** A trigger that starts a workflow (e.g., push, pull_request).
- **Job:** A set of steps that execute on a runner.
- **Step:** An individual task, either a shell command or an action.
- **Action:** A reusable unit of code.
- **Runner:** A server that runs your workflows.

## Example Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

## Common Use Cases
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Building and packaging applications
- Deploying to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Publishing packages to registries (npm, Docker Hub)
- Automating repository management tasks
