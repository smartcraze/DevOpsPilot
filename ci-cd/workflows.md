# CI/CD Workflows

A CI/CD workflow is an automated process for building, testing, and deploying code changes.

## Typical Stages of a CI/CD Workflow

1.  **Commit:** Developers push code to a shared repository (e.g., Git).

2.  **Build:** The CI server automatically pulls the code and builds the application. This includes compiling code and gathering dependencies.

3.  **Test:** Automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are run to check for regressions and bugs.

4.  **Deploy to Staging:** If tests pass, the application is deployed to a staging environment, which mirrors production.

5.  **Deploy to Production:** After manual approval or further automated checks, the application is deployed to the production environment for users.

## Benefits
- **Faster Release Cycles:** Automation speeds up the development process.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Automated testing catches bugs early.
- **Reduced Risk:** Staged deployments and automated checks minimize production failures.
- **Increased Developer Productivity:** Developers can focus on writing code instead of manual deployment tasks.

## Key Principles
- **Automate Everything:** The entire build-to-deploy process should be automated.
- **Keep a Single Source Repository:** All code and configurations should be version controlled.
- **Test at Every Stage:** Ensure quality throughout the pipeline.
- **Deploy in Small Increments:** Make small, frequent releases to reduce risk.
